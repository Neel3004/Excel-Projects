# This repository contains 2 Excel Projects I worked on.

## Bike Sales
Dataset is located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sadiqshah/bike-store-sales-in-europe/input). 
Problem was to decide what motivates the users to buy the bikes. The dataset with user's demographic is very diverse with different features like marital status, income, gender, education, do they own cars or not and a few more. 
I interpreted and analyzed the dataset to determine what were the driving features - economical, geographical or pyschological behind the decision making. Using pivot tables, I created a dashboard to generate insights that would eventually lead to decision making for the company.

## V-lookup, H-lookup and X-lookup

The goal of this project is to learn about how to use vertical, horizontal and X-lookup. Based on the dataset created certain realistic questions one might have to answer on a day-to-day basis and how can that be achieved using lookups.
