## This repository contains 2 Excel Projects I worked on.

# Bike Sales
### Dataset is located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sadiqshah/bike-store-sales-in-europe/input). 
### Problem was to decide what motivates the users to buy the bikes. The dataset with user's demographic is very diverse with different features like marital status, income, gender, education, do they own cars or not and a few more. 
### I interpreted and analyzed the dataset to determine what were the driving features - economical, geographical or pyschological behind the decision making. Using pivot tables, I created a dashboard to generate insights that would eventually lead to decision making for the company.
